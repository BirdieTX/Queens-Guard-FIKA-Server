1. You need to have the most up to date version of these three Microsoft plugins for a modded Tarkov install to work correctly:

    - https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/thank-you/net472-developer-pack-offline-installer
	- https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-6.0.4-windows-x64-installer
	- https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-8.0.3-windows-x86-installer

Download each of these packages and install them by running each executable.

2. Make sure your live Tarkov client is fully up to date. **You will need to run EFT at leat once on your regular Tarkov client, make a character and get to the point where you can enter your stash screen.**

3. Make a folder called "MPT" at a desired location. ***Do not put the MPT folder in your Desktop, Documents, Videos, Pictures, Music, Downloads or either of the Program Files folders. I reccomend just putting the MPT folder in your C:/ drive, or if you want it on another drive that is also fine. If you put the MPT folder in any of these locations and you run into problems, I am not going to help you.***

4. In your BSG Launcher click on "Game Settings" and then click on "Browse Local Files". Copy everything in here except the BattleEye folder and put it into your MPT folder.

5. Download the client plugins here: https://github.com/BirdieTX/Queens-Guard-FIKA-Server/archive/refs/heads/main.zip

6. Copy everything in the MPT folder in the ZIP file into the MPT folder that you made.

7. Run the "patcher.exe" file. If you get any errors up to this point you either didn't download the plugins in step 1, didn't update your Tarkov client or you have a corrupted Tarkov install and you will need to talk to Birdie about manually patching the game.

8. Delete "patcher.exe" once it is done.

9. Run "SPT.Launcher" (this is the program you will run to play on the MPT server instead of BSG Launcher).

10. SPT Launcher will initially say there is no server available. Click on the settings tab in the top right when this happens.

11. Enable developer mode and paste this address in the URL box: http://108.181.213.65:6969

12. Click the back arrow in the top right. You will be able to create a profile and play the game now. ***When you unlock the flea market, do not sell items on the flea, it won't work and you will corrupt someones profile if they try to buy items that were posted by you on the flea market (auto generated flea market postings are fine). If you do this I AM NOT going to help you fix a corrupted profile! Please look over all of the changes I've made from the live game and look over known issues as well.***
